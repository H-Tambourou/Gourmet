            <h2>Not a diet just lifestyle eating</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Food fuels the everyday motions of life. But the choices of what to eat are endless and sometimes not all good. Yet, at its best food can be a preventive medicine against many diseases and help the body maintain through all the motions of life.<br><br><br>At gourmet, our goal is to re-invent the way we think of food and our relationship to it. Not through the usual boring diet, but through simple suggestions of food. That's right all we do is suggest food and you incorporate them into your daily life. So get fancy with it if you want, throw on the chef hat, at the end day its your choice. </p>
